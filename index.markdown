This project is part of an AudiAnnotate lesson plan that uses the audio recording ["'Criminal Syndicalism' case, McComb, Mississippi,"](https://hrc.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p15878coll1/id/37/rec/1) from the Harry Ransom Center's [John Beecher Sound Recordings Collection](https://hrc.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p15878coll1). This project page exists as a sample project to facilitate understanding of what a collaborative classroom project could look like. 

You can access our Introduction to Annotating and Presenting Sensitive Audio Using AudiAnnotate [here](https://bethanycayeradcliff.github.io/sensitive-audio-lesson/) and the asynchronous lesson plan [here](https://kywark.github.io/example-sensitive-audio-lesson-syndicalism/).
