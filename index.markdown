This project is part of an AudiAnnotate lesson plan that uses the audio recording “‘Criminal Syndicalism’ case, McComb, Mississippi,” from the Harry Ransom Center’s John Beecher Sound Recordings Collection. This project page exists as a sample project to facilitate understanding of what a collaborative classroom project could look like.

You can access the Introduction to Annotating and Presenting Sensitive Audio Using AudiAnnotate here and the asynchronous lesson plan here.
