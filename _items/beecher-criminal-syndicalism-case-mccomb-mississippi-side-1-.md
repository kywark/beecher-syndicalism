This project is part of an AudiAnnotate lesson plan that uses the audio recording ["'Criminal Syndicalism' case, McComb, Mississippi,"](https://hrc.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p15878coll1/id/37/rec/1) from the Harry Ransom Center's [John Beecher Sound Recordings Collection](https://hrc.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p15878coll1). This project page exists as a sample project to facilitate understanding of what a collaborative classroom project could look like. 

You can access the lesson plan here. 

In this recording, a racial slur is used at 16:06 by a student quoting the language said to them by a police officer while in jail. There is also explicit language used at 15:49, 16:30, and 16:39 by students quoting white police officers. Racial slurs are timestampled below.
