This project is part of an AudiAnnotate lesson plan that uses the audio recording ["'Criminal Syndicalism' case, McComb, Mississippi,"](https://hrc.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p15878coll1/id/37/rec/1) from the Harry Ransom Center's [John Beecher Sound Recordings Collection](https://hrc.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p15878coll1). This project page exists as a sample project to facilitate understanding of what a collaborative classroom project could look like. 

You can access the lesson plan [here](https://hipstas.github.io/AudiAnnotate/lessonplan.html).

In this example, layer titles represent annotation categories. In the lesson, students will work collaboratively to select categories for annotation, and will each contribute annotations in their group work. In this example, we chose to annotate in the following categories: 
- Environment: Environmental sounds, which could be any noise, like cars in the distance, chairs scraping on the floor, or footsteps
- Speakers: This could include named or unnamed speakers
- Transcription: These annotations are selected sentences transcribed from the audio recording
- Topics: These are thematic tags or phrases based on the conversations and events in the recording

In this recording, a racial slur is used at 16:06 by a student quoting the language said to them by a police officer while in jail. There is also explicit language used at 15:49, 16:30, and 16:39 by students quoting white police officers. Racial slurs are time-stamped below, in the layer titled "Trigger_Warnings."
